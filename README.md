 Recreated a site known as  green brain, a site which allows students
 and to share and be able to lend school materials to enable them in their studies. It comprises of six pages;  a home page with links to the  rest of the site, a login page
 which allows you to login to the site to access this materials, a sign up page which enables you to sign up on the platform and create an account on it to give you access to the site,   lecture notes, Project materials and past questions pages where these materials of different courses and years can be gotten and shared. This site was built solely using bootstrap.
